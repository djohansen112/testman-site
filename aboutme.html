        <h2> About me!</h2>
        <p>I'm Dan, I'm a test engineer working in the industry but looking to switch over to the Test
            Automation track. I've been working as a manual tester for a few years, and while the work is what I
            expected,
            it's not what I wanted. So I've decided to create a site where I can gather my resources, like a
            filthy
            Warcraft Peon, and set out what I've learnt. This is all in the hope that it inspires someone else
            to create more resources like this. </p>
        <p>This site will be a blog of sorts. Part of the learning journey for me is about learning how web
            development
            works, because it's nearly impossible to test what you haven't had a shot at creating first. As
            such, this site will change as I learn more. At the time of beginning, I understand what HTML is
            for but never actually applied it to anything, so it's never really sunk in.
        </p>
        <p>My Github contains a few resources that I'm currently working on. Feel free to browse around and see what I'm up to.
